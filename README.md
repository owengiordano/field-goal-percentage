# Is Stephen Curry To Blame for Low Field Goal Percentage?

It is widely acknowledged that the most prominent NBA players exert a profound influence on the sport of basketball at all levels. Notable examples include Allen Iverson, who introduced a captivating style of dribbling, and Steve Nash, who popularized unconventional passes.

However, I am particularly intrigued by the impact of Stephen Curry's playing style. In order to delve into this topic more specifically, I would like to examine the relationship between the average number of three-pointers attempted per game and the overall field goal percentage. To accomplish this, I will compile data from the top players of each year since 1980, capturing their collective average field goal percentage alongside their collective average number of three-point attempts per game. These statistics will be organized into a comprehensive table.

Subsequently, I will construct a correlation matrix to ascertain the correlation coefficient, denoted as "r," which quantifies the relationship between the average number of three-point attempts per game and the average field goal percentage. By analyzing this correlation coefficient, I will be able to determine the slope and intercept values that establish the connection between the average field goal percentage and the average number of three-point attempts.

Armed with this valuable information, I will leverage my expertise in linear regression to predict the field goal percentage based on the number of three-point attempts per game. In this context, the number of three-point attempts will serve as the independent variable, while the field goal percentage will function as the dependent variable.
